            "required :  Ever noticed how plane seats appear to be getting smaller and smaller? With increasing numbers of people taking to the skies, some experts are questioning if having such packed out planes is putting passengers at risk. They say that the shrinking space on aeroplanes is not only uncomfortable - it's putting our health and safety in danger. More than squabbling over the arm rest, shrinking space on planes putting our health and safety in danger? This week, a U.S consumer advisory group set up by the Department of Transportation said at a public hearing that while the government is happy to set standards for animals flying on planes, it doesn't stipulate a minimum amount of space for humans. 'In a world where animals have more rights to space and food than humans,' said Charlie Leocha, consumer representative on the committee. 'It is time that the DOT and FAA take a stand for humane treatment of passengers.' But could crowding on planes lead to more serious issues than fighting for space in the overhead lockers, crashing elbows and seat back kicking? Tests conducted by the FAA use planes with a 31 inch pitch, a standard which on some airlines has decreased . Many economy seats on United Airlines have 30 inches of room, while some airlines offer as little as 28 inches . Cynthia Corbertt, a human factors researcher with the Federal Aviation Administration, that it conducts tests on how quickly passengers can leave a plane. But these tests are conducted using planes with 31 inches between each row of seats, a standard which on some airlines has decreased, reported the Detroit News. The distance between two seats from one point on a seat to the same point on the seat behind it is known as the pitch. While most airlines stick to a pitch of 31 inches or above, some fall below this. While United Airlines has 30 inches of space, Gulf Air economy seats have between 29 and 32 inches, Air Asia offers 29 inches and Spirit Airlines offers just 28 inches. British Airways has a seat pitch of 31 inches, while easyJet has 29 inches, Thomson's short haul seat pitch is 28 inches, and Virgin Atlantic's is 30-31.\n",

The Reds were linked with a move for the 25-year-old, whose contract expires in June, earlier in the season when Simon Mignolet was dropped from the side. A January move for Neto never materialised but the former Atletico Paranaense keeper looks certain to leave the Florence-based club in the summer. Neto rushes from his goal as Juan Iturbe bears down on him during Fiorentina's clash with Roma in March . Neto is wanted by a number of top European clubs including Liverpool and PSG, according to his agent . It had been reported that Neto had a verbal agreement to join Serie A champions Juventus at the end of the season but his agent has revealed no decision about his future has been made yet. And Castagna claims Neto will have his pick of top European clubs when the transfer window re-opens in the summer, including Brendan Rodgers' side. 'There are many European clubs interested in Neto, such as for example Liverpool and Paris Saint-Germain,' Stefano Castagna is quoted as saying by Gazzetta TV. Firoentina goalkeeper Neto saves at the feet of Tottenham midfielder Nacer Chadli in the Europa League . 'In Spain too there are clubs at the very top level who are tracking him. Real Madrid? We'll see. 'We have not made a definitive decision, but in any case he will not accept another loan move elsewhere.' Neto, who represented Brazil at the London 2012 Olympics but has not featured for the senior side, was warned against joining a club as a No 2 by national coach Dunga. Neto joined Fiorentina from Atletico Paranaense in 2011 and established himself as No1 in the last two seasons.\n",

            "required :  Bruce Jenner will break his silence in a two-hour interview with Diane Sawyer later this month. The former Olympian and reality TV star, 65, will speak in a 'far-ranging' interview with Sawyer for a special edition of '20/20' on Friday April 24, ABC News announced on Monday. The interview comes amid growing speculation about the father-of-six's transition to a woman, and follows closely behind his involvement in a deadly car crash in California in February. And while the Kardashian women are known for enjoying center stage, they will not be stealing Bruce's spotlight because they will be in Armenia when the interview airs, according to TMZ. Scroll down for video . Speaking out: Bruce Jenner, pictured on 'Keeping Up with the Kardashians' will speak out in a 'far-ranging' interview with Diane Sawyer later this month, ABC News announced on Monday . Return: Diane Sawyer, who recently mourned the loss of her husband, will return to ABC for the interview . Rumors started swirling around Jenner's gender identity last year, when he emerged from a Beverly Hills clinic with his Adam's apple shaved down. His behavior over the past year also fueled speculation as he began embracing an increasingly female appearance, including growing out his hair, shaving his legs and painting his nails, while reportedly undergoing hormone therapy. He also split from with his wife of more than two decades, Kris Jenner, with whom he has two daughters, Kyle and Kendall. She filed for divorce in September 2014, citing 'irreconcilable differences'. Reports also emerged over the past week that he has received a breast enhancement. 'Bruce had silicone breast implants put in a few weeks ago,' a source told RadarOnline. 'He went with a smaller implant because he didn't want to look ridiculous.' On Sunday, he was seen walking to his car in Malibu but hid his body beneath a bulky sweatshirt. Out and about: Jenner was pictured walking back to his car in Malibu on the weekend and hiding beneath a large sweatshirt on Sunday, days after reports that he had undergone a breast enhancement . Hiding: He also apparently had painted his nails red when he was seen walking on Sunday . According to Radar, Jenner wants to have all surgeries completed in time to make his on-screen debut as a woman on the fall season of 'Dancing with the Stars'. Jenner is also rumored to be filming a spin-off docu-series about the transition on E!, although his reps have refused to confirm the claims. While Jenner himself has remained silent about his reported transition, some of his relatives, including step-daughter Kim Kardashian, have spoken about about his 'journey'. 'I guess I'll kind of let everyone be curious and I feel like that's his journey to talk about,' Kim recently told Entertainment Tonight. 'I will say that I think Bruce should tell his story his way. I think everyone goes through things in life and I think that story and what Bruce is going through, I think he'll share whenever the time is right.' Jenner, who won gold in the decathlon at the 1976 Olympics, also made headlines earlier this year for his involvement in a deadly car crash in Malibu. Deadly: In February, Jenner's vehicle, which was pulling a trailer and an ATV (seen right) rear-ended a woman's car (left) and pushed it into the lane of an oncoming Hummer. She died at the scene . By his side: Bruce, pictured with his ex-wife Kris Jenner and four of his step-children (from left) Rob, Kim, Kourtney and Khloe, has received support from his family. Kris filed for divorce from him last year . His Cadillac Escalade, which was pulling a trailer and off-road vehicle, plowed into the back of a Lexus and pushed it into the path of an oncoming Hummer on February 7. The Lexus was carrying 69-year-old Kim Howe, who died from chest trauma at the scene. Police sources say Jenner is unlikely to be prosecuted because he wasn't drinking, speeding or texting at the time of the fatal crash. His tell-all interview will also be one of Sawyer's first forays back to TV news following the death of her husband, acclaimed director Mike Nichols, following a heart attack last November.

The prize porker, known  as Pigwig, had fallen into the pool in an upmarket neighbourhood in Ringwood, Hampshire. His owners had been taking him for a walk around the garden when the animal plunged into the water and was unable to get out. A team from Dorset Fire and Rescue struggled to haul the huge black pig out of swimming pool water . The prize porker known as Pigwig had fallen into the water and had then been unable to get out again . Two fire crews and a specialist animal rescue team had to use slide boards and strops to haul the huge black pig from the small pool. A spokesman for Dorset Fire and Rescue Service said: 'At 4.50pm yesterday the service received a call to a pig stuck in a swimming pool. 'One crew of firefighters from Ferndown and a specialist animal rescue unit from Poole were mobilised to this incident. 'Once in attendance the crew secured the pig with strops, and requested the attendance of another appliance which was mobilised from Ringwood by our colleagues in Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service. Firefighters were also called out to a horse which had fallen into a swimming pool in Heyshott, West Sussex . The exhausted animal had to be winched to using an all-terrain crane but appeared no worse for wear after its tumble . 'The crew rescued the pig from the swimming pool using specialist animal rescue slide boards, strops and lines to haul the pig from the swimming pool.' But Pigwig wasn't the only animal who needed rescuing after taking an unexpected swim . Crews in West Sussex were called out to a swimming pool where this time a horse had fallen in. Wet and very bedraggled, the exhausted animal put up no opposition when firefighters arrived to hoist her out of the small garden pool in Heyshott. The two-hour rescue operation ended with the wayward horse being fitted with straps under her belly and lifted up into the air with an all-terrain crane before being swung around and deposited back on dry land.

            "required :  The amount of time people spend listening to BBC radio has dropped to its lowest level ever, the corporation’s boss has admitted. Figures show that while millions still tune in, they listen for much shorter bursts. The average listener spent just ten hours a week tuning in to BBC radio in the last three months of 2014, according to official figures. The length of time people spend listening to BBC radio has dropped to its lowest level ever, figures show . This was 14 per cent down on a decade earlier, when listeners clocked up an average of 11.6 hours a week. The minutes of the BBC Trust’s February meeting, published yesterday, revealed that director general Tony Hall highlighted the fall. ‘He noted…that time spent listening to BBC radio had dropped to its lowest ever level,’ the documents said. Sources blamed the downward trend on people leading faster-paced lives than in the past, and a change in habits amongst young people. Lord Tony Hall, BBC director general, highlighted the decline to the BBC Trust, according to minutes of its February meeting . Many people who used to listen to radio as a daily habit now turn to online streaming services such as Spotify for their music fix. That problem is likely to grow, as Apple develops its long-rumoured streaming service. A BBC spokesman said: ‘The number of people listening to BBC radio stations and audience appreciation levels are as high as ever. ‘But time spent listening has inevitably been affected by digital competition and as people ‘tune in’ in new, digital ways. ‘[Those ways] aren’t reflected in the traditional listening figures quoted here – like watching videos from radio shows or listening to podcasts.’ BBC radio is still reaching 65 per cent of the population each week, according to the last set of figures available from RAJAR, the organisation which measures radio audiences. But although that figure feels relatively healthy by today’s standards, it has none the less fallen by more over the last decade. In the final three months of 2004, 66 per cent of people in Britain listened to BBC network radio every week. Lord Hall also used the BBC Trust meeting to note the strong performance of BBC Radio 6, the digital music station which the Corporation had at one point been planning to scrap. ‘He reported that the recent RAJAR figures showed that 6Music had become the first digital-only station to reach two million listeners,’ the minutes said. Earlier this month, Matthew Postgate, the BBC’s chief technology officer, said the Corporation would adopt a new ‘digital first’ strategy, to help it target a new generation of users. He said the organisation needed to ‘learn lessons’ if they want to ‘compete with organisations that were born in the digital age’.\n",

Co-star John Stamos announced Monday night on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live\" that Netflix has ordered up a reunion special, followed by a spinoff series called \"Fuller House.\" The show will feature Candace Cameron Bure, who played eldest daughter D.J. Tanner in the original series -- which aired from 1987 to 1995 -- as the recently widowed mother of three boys. \"It's sort of a role reversal, and we turn the house over to her,\" Stamos told Kimmel.

Stamos will produce and guest star. Talks with co-starsBob Saget, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, Dave Coulier and Lori Loughlin are ongoing, Netflix said. The show will be available next year, Netflix said. \"As big fans of the original Full House, we are thrilled to be able to introduce Fuller House's new narrative to existing fans worldwide, who grew up on the original, as well as a new generation of global viewers that have grown up with the Tanners in syndication,\"  Netflix Vice President of Original Content Cindy Holland said in a statement. The show starts with Tanner -- now named Tanner-Fuller (get it ... Fuller?) -- pregnant, recently widowed and living in San Francisco. Her younger sister Stephanie -- now an aspiring musician -- and her lifelong best friend and fellow single mom, Kimmy, move in to help her care for her two boys and the new baby.

            "required :  At 11:20pm, former world champion Ken Doherty potted a final black and extinguished, for now, the dream of Reanne Evans to become the first women player to play the hallowed baize of Sheffield's Crucible Theatre in the world snooker championship. In every other respect however, 29-year-old Evans, a single mum from Dudley, was a winner on Thursday night. She advanced the cause of women in sport no end and gave Doherty the fright of his life in an enthralling and attritional match that won't be bettered in this year's qualifying tournament. Snooker's governing body had been criticised in some quarters for allowing Evans a wild card to compete alongside 127 male players for the right to play in the sport's blue-chip event on April 18 - something no female had achieved. Reanne Evans shakes hands with Ken Doherty following his 10-8 victory at Ponds Forge . Evans plays a shot during her world championship qualifying match against Doherty . Doherty, who won the World Championship title back in 1997, took out the first frame 71-15 . Evans had Doherty in all sorts of trouble before the former champion closed out the game 10-8 . Those critics and the bookies who made Doherty a ridiculously short-priced 20/1 on favourite were made to look foolish as Evans had her illustrious opponent on the ropes before finally bowing out 10-8. A gracious Doherty admitted afterwards: 'She played out of her skin. It was good match play snooker and tough all the way through. There was a lot of pressure on this match, a different kind of pressure to what I've ever experienced. 'I don't usually feel sympathy for my opponents but I felt sorry at the end. She played better than me and lost. I don't know how I won that final frame. If it had gone to 9-9, I'd have been a million-to-one to win it.' Evans, cheered on by her eight-year-old daughter Lauren at the Ponds Forge sports centre in Sheffield, admitted she was exhausted after a match of unfamiliar intensity for her. A 10-time ladies' champion, Evans had led twice during the opening session before Doherty went 5-4 in front . The 10-time ladies world champion collected just £400 as prize money for winning the title in 2013, and this was a completely different environment against a player who beat Stephen Hendry to be crowned the best player in the world in 1997. 'It was a struggle. With the experience Ken had, I just had to dig in,' she said. 'Ken had little runs when he needed it but I could tell he was under pressure. Some of the balls were wobbling in from the first frame. I just couldn't take advantage in the end. 'I can play better than I did so there is no reason I can't return and beat Ken or even players above him. I have the women's game on my shoulders. I just hope I get some help and am allowed to play in more big tournaments to give me experience. 'Next week, I will playing the ladies in the club again. It's a lovely club don't get me wrong but I don't think many ladies could give Ken a game. I think I would have won if I'd taken it to 9-9.' The presence of television crews and snooker star Ronnie O'Sullivan underlined what a big story Evans' participation was. Evans eyes up her move during an enthralling game with Doherty in Sheffield . She lost the first frame convincingly but the nerves didn't show after that. She reeled off three frames in a row, led 4-3 and once Doherty went in front, pegged him back to 5-5 and 6-6. The Irishman, now ranked No 46 in the world, started to look his 45 years. He sat down at every opportunity while Evans often stood while he played. She had the confidence to play right-handed or left-handed, as O'Sullivan sometimes does. The key frame was the sixteenth. It lasted 45 minutes with Evans rattling off the first 59 points and Doherty the next 74. It took Doherty to a 9-7 lead but Evans came roaring back in the next frame. He needed a snooker to avoid the match going into a final frame – and he got it. Doherty, now ranked No 46 in the world, showed his experience to close out the contest . He has two more qualifying rounds before he makes the Crucible but it's doubtful he will face a tougher opponent. 'They should let her play in more competitions,' he added. Evans should certainly use this match to become a leading ambassador for women's sport. Her purple and silver waistcoats drew admiring glances from the swimmers and trampolinists who turned up at the leisure centre as normal as she walked through reception to the basketball hall, where 10 snooker tables had been set up. Next time they will know exactly who she is, and what she can do.\n",

            "required :  A gang of six men have been jailed for a total of 31 years after being convicted of a string of sexual offences against teenager girls. The offences, which ranged from inciting sexual activity with a child, to rape, happened in cars, woods or at the defendants' homes in Banbury, Oxfordshire. Oxford Crown Court heard how they lured victims to parties organised on social media and then began sexually abusing them. The men were found guilty in March and have now been handed sentences of between three and nine years in jail. Jailed: Ahmed Hassan-Sule, 21 (left) was sentenced to nine years' imprisonment. Mohamed Saleh, 22, (right) was imprisoned for four years and nine months . The girls, aged between 13 and 16, were targeted by the gang  at under-18s parties organised by Ahmed Hassan-Sule, 21, known as 'Fiddy'. One child described the parties as 'a place where girls would go and the boys would choose their targets'. The victims, who were described in court as 'emotionally immature' were abused from 2009 to 2014. Sentencing Hassan-Sule and the others in a court packed with friends and relatives of the defendants and victims yesterday, Judge Zoe Smith said: 'You put on charity events to raise money for your football club. 'This raised your profile among young people in Banbury and you saw yourself as a celebrity. 'Your friends helped put on these events and you became a sexually promiscuous group, not with your own girlfriends, but with girls who were young, vulnerable and lacking in maturity.' The judge rejected the argument put forward by the defence, who accused the girls of coming forward because 'it's better to be a victim than a slag'. Behind bars: Kagiso Manase, 26, (left) was jailed for four years and Said Saleh, 20, (right) was sentenced to four years' detention in a Young Offenders Institute . One of the victims told the Oxford Mail: 'When I used to go missing I would swear at my mum and I didn't realise I was being really nasty to her. The men put me against my family – it was really clever. When I started hanging around with them I felt important. 'I had no friends and they were the only people left to talk to. It was a big part of my life and I was scared. I felt like all my friends were making new memories and I wasn't part of them. 'Calling people \"slags\" as the defence did in this case stops other girls from coming forward. I would say to other girls to think about the future. I never wanted to do it. I never wanted to have sex with them but I thought that's what friends did.' Thames Valley Police launched Operation Reportage after receiving a tip-off about the men's activities and eventually tracked down numerous teenager girls who had been molested. Detective Inspector Steve Raffield from Banbury Force CID said: 'This result would not have been possible without the bravery of the victims. 'I would like to thank them for coming forward and giving evidence in this case. As in all trials without their testimony we would not be where we are today. 'As a result young people will be safeguarded while these men will have time to reflect upon their actions in prison.' Convicted: Takudzwa Hova, 21, (left) was sentenced to six years' imprisonment, while Zsolt Szalontai, 18, (right) was sentenced to three years' detention in a Young Offenders' Institute after being found guilty of rape . Justice: The judge rejected the argument put forward by the defence at Oxford Crown Court (pictured), who accused the girls of coming forward because 'it's better to be a victim than a slag' Those jailed on Friday afternoon at Oxford Crown Court were: Ahmed Hassan-Sule, 21, of Banbury, who was found guilty of 13 counts of sexual activity with a child and one count of assault by penetration. He was sentenced to nine years' imprisonment. Mohamed Saleh, 22, of Banbury, was found guilty of two counts of sexual activity with a child. He was sentenced to four years and nine months' imprisonment. Said Saleh, 20, from Banbury, was found guilty of one count of sexual activity with a child. He was sentenced to four years' detention in a Young Offenders Institute. Takudzwa Hova, 21, of Banbury, was found guilty of one count of sexual activity with a child, two counts of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity and one count of rape. He was sentenced to six years' imprisonment. Kagiso Manase, 26, of Banbury, was found guilty of two counts of sexual activity with a child, two counts of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity and one count of sexual assault. He was sentenced to four years' imprisonment. Manase had also pleaded guilty to possession of identity documents with intent. The offence related to being found in possession or control of a false South African passport and UK residence permit. He was sentenced to one year imprisonment to run consecutively.

Tunisian skipper Mohammed Ali Malek, 27, was arrested when he stepped onto Sicilian soil last night, some 24 hours after his  boat capsized in the Mediterranean. Before leaving the Italian coastguard vessel, however, he was forced to watch the bodies of 24 victims of the tragedy being carried off the ship for burial on the island of Malta. He was later charged with multiple manslaughter, causing a shipwreck and aiding illegal immigration. Prosecutors claim he contributed to the disaster by mistakenly ramming the overcrowded fishing boat into a merchant ship that had come to its rescue. As a result of the collision, the migrants shifted position on the boat, which was already off balance, causing it to overturn. Scroll down for videos . Nervous: Tunisian boat captain Mohammed Ali Malek (centre) bites his nails as he waits to disembark an Italian coastguard ship before being arrested over the deaths of 950 migrants who died when his ship sank . 'Killer': Malek, 27, was arrested when he stepped onto Sicilian soil last night some 24 hours after his overcrowded boat capsized in the Mediterranean. He has been charged with multiple manslaughter . In the dock: Malek affords a smile alongside his alleged smuggler accomplice, a 26-year-old Syrian crew member named Mahmud Bikhit, who was also arrested and charged with 'favouring illegal immigration' A police handout showing Mohammed Ali Malek (left) and Mahmud Bikhit (right) after their arrest in Malta . Malek was also pictured with his alleged smuggler accomplice, a 26-year-old Syrian crew member named Mahmud Bikhit, who charged with 'aiding illegal immigration. Both men were to be put before a judge later today. Catania prosecutor Giovanni Salvi's office stressed that none of the crew aboard the Portuguese-flagged King Jacob is under investigation in the disaster. He said the crew members did their job in coming to the rescue of a ship in distress and that their activities 'in no way contributed to the deadly event.' Meanwhile, the survivors were brought to a migrant holding center in Catania and were 'very tired, very shocked, silent,' according to Flavio Di Giacomo of the International Organization for Migration. Most of the survivors and the victims appear to have been young men but there were also several children aged between 10 and 12, she added. 'We have not yet been able to ask them about this but it seems certain that many of them will have had friends and family who were lost in the wreck.' Deep in thought: Malek stares in space while waiting to leave the rescue vessel. Survivors told how women and children died 'like rats in a cage' after being locked into the boat's hold by callous traffickers in Libya . They told yesterday how women and children died 'like rats in a cage' after being locked into the boat's hold by callous traffickers in Libya. Some resorted to clinging to their floating corpses until Italian and Maltese coastguards came to rescue them in the dead of the night. The coast guard, meanwhile, reported that it saved some 638 migrants in six different rescue operations on Monday alone. On Tuesday, a further 446 people were rescued from a leaking migrant ship about 80 miles (130 kilometers) south of the Calabrian coast. At talks in Luxembourg on Monday, EU ministers agreed on a 10-point plan to double the resources available to maritime border patrol mission Triton and further measures will be discussed at a summit of EU leaders on Thursday. Victims: Malek watches some of the bodies being taken off the rescue ship for burial in Malta . Grim: Survivors said they resorted to clinging to floating corpses until coastguards came to their rescue . Relaxed: Malek grins on the desk of the Italian coastguard ship next to some of the migrant survivors . Critics say Triton is woefully inadequate and are demanding the restoration of a much bigger Italian operation suspended last year because of cost constraints. The survivors, who hailed from Mali, Gambia, Senegal, Somalia, Eritrea and Bangladesh, were all recovering Tuesday at holding centres near Catania on Sicily's eastern coast. Sunday's disaster was the worst in a series of migrant shipwrecks that have claimed more than 1,700 lives this year - 30 times higher than the same period in 2014 - and nearly 5,000 since the start of last year. In that time nearly 200,000 migrants have made it to Italy, mostly after being rescued at sea by the Italian navy and coastguard. Italian officials believe there could be up to one million more would-be immigrants to Europe waiting to board boats in conflict-torn Libya. Many of them are refugees from Syria's civil war or persecution in places like Eritrea. Others are seeking to escape poverty and hunger in Africa and south Asia and secure a better future in Europe. Meanwhile, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott urged the EU to introduce tough measures to stop migrants attempting to make the perilous sea voyage from North Africa to Europe. Mr Abbott, whose conservative government introduced a military-led operation to turn back boats carrying asylum-seekers before they reach Australia, said it was the only way to stop deaths. Hardline: Tony Abbott, whose conservative government introduced a military-led operation to turn back boats carrying asylum-seekers before they reach Australia, said harsh measures are the only way to stop deaths . Haunted: Surviving immigrants who escaped the boat that capsized in the Mediterranean Sea killing up to 900 people appear deep in thought as they arrive in the Sicilian port city of Catania this morning . While Mr Abbott's controversial policy has proved successful, with the nation going nearly 18 months with virtually no asylum-seeker boat arrivals and no reported deaths at sea, human rights advocates say it violates Australia's international obligations. His comments came as EU foreign and interior ministers met in Luxembourg to discuss ways to stem the flood of people trying to reach Europe. Outlining his views on preventing the deaths of migrants in the Mediterranean Sea, Mr Abbott told reporters: 'We have got hundreds, maybe thousands of people drowning in the attempts to get from Africa to Europe.' The 'only way you can stop the deaths is in fact to stop the boats', he added. Yesterday, the Maltese Prime Minister declared a crisis, calling for EU countries to reinstate rescue operations. He warned: 'A time will come when Europe will be judged harshly for its inaction when it turned a blind eye to genocide. 'We have what is fast becoming a failed state on our doorsteps and criminal gangs are enjoying a heyday.' He estimated smugglers behind the doomed voyage from Libya to Europe would have made between €1million and €5million from selling desperate refugees spaces on the boat.\n",

The prosecutors' office in Seoul said Kim, was charged with attempted murder, violence against a foreign envoy and obstruction of duty. Kim, 55, was a known maverick activist who had been handed a two-year suspended sentence in 2010 for hurling a rock at the then Japanese ambassador to Seoul. He has denied any intention to kill Lippert, but the prosecutors office said in a statement that the crime was clearly deliberate. 'There was an intention to murder because (Kim) used a lethal weapon in a pre-meditated crime to attack the ambassador's face and neck repeatedly,' it said. Kim has told investigators the ambassador was the 'symbolic' target of his opposition to annual US-South Korea joint military exercises, which he blames for blocking dialogue with North Korea. The annual drills have long been condemned by Pyongyang as rehearsals for invasion. Kim insisted he had acted alone and not on the orders of Pyongyang, but prosecutors said they were looking into whether he has violated the South's strict National Security Law banning any act seen as aiding North Korea or promoting its ideology. Investigators have ransacked Kim's home as part of an investigation into Kim's possible links with North Korea. Kim had visited the North seven times and once tried to erect a memorial in Seoul to the late North Korean leader Kim Jong-Il after his death in 2011. North Korea has rejected accusations that it may have been behind the attack as a 'vicious' smear campaign by Seoul.

            "required :  (CNN)Warren Weinstein, who appears to have been the only American citizen held hostage by al Qaeda, was accidentally killed in a U.S. drone strike in January. But it didn't have to be that way. A senior U.S. official familiar with the handling of the issue told CNN that the U.S. government made no serious effort to negotiate for the 73-year-old development expert's release, either directly to al Qaeda or through proxies in Pakistan. Another senior U.S. official told CNN that Weinstein's capture by al Qaeda made it hard for the United States to negotiate, even though proxies such as the Pakistani government have links to intermediaries who might have helped. A senior Pakistani official told CNN that after Weinstein was kidnapped, the Pakistani government put out feelers to members of the militant Haqqani Network and to the Pakistani Taliban, which are both allied to al Qaeda, to see if these groups might be able to initiate some kind of negotiation about Weinstein. According to the official, nothing came of those feelers. The senior Pakistani official says that during the past year Pakistani soldiers, who were part of a military offensive in the tribal area of North Waziristan near the Afghan-Pakistan border where Weinstein was believed to be being held, went door-to-door looking for the American. Nothing came of this search either. On Thursday, the U.S. government announced that Weinstein had been killed in a \"counterterrorism operation\" in January, which is how the government often describes CIA drone strikes. According to New America, which tracks drone strikes in Pakistan, CIA drone attacks happened in Shawal, North Waziristan, on January 19 in which at least four militants were killed; also on January 15 in Tehsil Ladha, South Waziristan, in which at least five militants were killed; and on January 4 in Datta Khel, South Waziristan, in which at least eight militants were killed. It is in one of these strikes that Weinstein was almost certainly killed. Lt. Col. Jason Amerine, a planner on the U.S. Army staff, is under investigation over a purported unauthorized disclosure to U.S. Rep. Duncan Hunter's office, which has demonstrated a strong interest in the fate of American hostages held by al Qaeda and the Taliban. A plan was developed in the Pentagon to secure the release of Weinstein, according to a staff member on Hunter's committee. That plan was to release Haji Bashir Noorzai, a prominent and influential member of the Taliban who is in prison in the States on drug trafficking charges, in exchange for U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Berghdal, who was held by the Taliban until last year; Taliban hostages Caitlin Coleman, a U.S. citizen, and her husband, Canadian Joshua Boyle; and Dr. Shakil Afridi, who spied for the CIA in Pakistan and was being held in a Pakistani prison, as well as Weinstein. It's not clear how far this plan of action went. Amerine is invoking whistleblower protection and denies making an unauthorized disclosure. Hunter, a California Republican, released a statement Thursday, saying, \"The only government organization seriously developing options to recover Weinstein and others in the Afghanistan/Pakistan region was within the Pentagon -- led by war hero Jason Amerine.\" As an Army captain, Amerine led a small detachment of U.S. Special Forces into Afghanistan in November 2001 in the wake of the September 11 attacks on the United States. The operation was instrumental in helping to topple the Taliban and to install Hamid Karzai as the new leader of Afghanistan. Who exactly carried out Weinstein's kidnapping from his house 3½  years ago in the Pakistani megacity of Lahore has until now not been clear. A senior Pakistani counterterrorism official told CNN that members of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, or IMU, kidnapped Weinstein at his Lahore home on August 13, 2011. IMU is an Uzbek terrorist group headquartered in the tribal regions of Pakistan along its border with Afghanistan. According to the Pakistani official, the leader of the Weinstein kidnapping cell was a relative of Tahir Yuldashev, the former IMU leader killed in a CIA drone strike in the Pakistani tribal regions in 2009. The initial lead that traced the Weinstein kidnapping to the IMU came from another high-profile kidnapping in Pakistan two weeks after Weinstein's abduction. Shahbaz Taseer, the son of a leading Pakistani liberal politician Salman Taseer -- who was killed by Pakistani militants eight months earlier -- was kidnapped in Lahore on August 26, 2011. At the scene of Taseer's kidnapping one of the kidnappers dropped a cell phone and SIM card that eventually led Pakistani officials to focus on the IMU group in Lahore, according to the senior Pakistani counterterrorism official. The police subsequently arrested three Uzbeks and four Pakistanis who were part of the IMU cell that had carried out the Weinstein kidnapping. Members of the IMU cell told Pakistani interrogators that after they had kidnapped Weinstein they moved him while he was tranquilized and semi-conscious among three safe houses in Lahore. IMU members then took Weinstein to the Federally Administered Tribal Areas in Pakistan, a semi-autonomous region along the border with Afghanistan where al Qaeda and other militant groups are headquartered. There Weinstein was given or, more likely, sold to al Qaeda, according to the senior Pakistani official. Who was Warren Weinstein? Weinstein had spent his life helping others, working in the fields of aid and development. He held a doctorate in international law and economics from Columbia University and spoke more than half a dozen languages. After his capture, the leader of al Qaeda, Ayman al-Zawahiri, demanded the end of CIA drone strikes in Pakistan and the release of terrorists held in U.S. custody in exchange for Weinstein's freedom. On September 12, 2012, Weinstein appeared in a video produced by al Qaeda's production arm in which he said that the Obama administration had shown \"no interest in my case.\" He then appealed to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu from \"one Jew to another\" to intervene. The Obama administration is in the midst of a review of its hostage policy, which has been criticized by some families whose loved ones have been taken hostage by ISIS, al Qaeda or the Taliban. The key problems these families point to are lack of communication by the U.S. government about their loved ones and a lack of coordination within the government about how best to free them. The CIA, for instance, is focused on drone strikes and counterterrorism operations, while the FBI has responsibility for retrieving American hostages. Often these goals are not in alignment -- as was clearly the case with Weinstein. The CIA could have exercised more due diligence knowing that Weinstein was almost certainly being held in North Waziristan. There are some solutions for these problems. First, families should be granted security clearances by the U.S. government for the purpose of having classified information disclosed to them only about their captive loved ones. Right now, the U.S. government won't communicate much with the families about their loved ones because the relatives don't have the requisite security clearances. Should families abuse their clearances, they would no longer receive classified information about their loved ones, which is a strong incentive not to abuse them. Second, President Barack Obama should appoint a senior-level person, perhaps working in the White House on the National Security Council, to oversee the work of the CIA, FBI, State Department and the Joint Special Operations Command, which implements hostage rescues. All these organizations have key roles to play in getting American hostages home. That person must be sufficiently senior so he or she can make all the relevant agencies play well together and \"de-conflict\" any potential issues, such as the ones that surfaced in the Weinstein case. Third, while the U.S. government position is that it will not make concessions to terrorist groups, there is nothing in American policy to prevent another government from negotiating with terrorists to secure the release of U.S. citizens, and this should be encouraged, even if there is some quid pro quo involved. This is what happened in the case of the American journalist Peter Theo Curtis, who was captured by al Qaeda's affiliate in Syria in 2012, but was released last year after the Qatari government intervened in his case. The Qataris have had longstanding ties to the militant groups in Syria, including the al Qaeda affiliate holding Curtis, and while Qatari officials have denied paying ransom to free Curtis, it's unlikely that the journalist was freed just because the members of al Qaeda holding him were suddenly feeling like good guys. Curtis' successful release could provide a ray of hope for U.S. citizen Caitlin Coleman and her husband, Canadian Joshua Boyle, who were captured by the Taliban in 2012 when they were traveling on a trip through Afghanistan. A senior American official told CNN they are being held by the Haqqani Network. The Pakistani government has contacts with the Haqqani Network, and the U.S. government should ratchet up the pressure on the Pakistani government to secure the couple's release. In captivity, Coleman, who was pregnant at the time she was taken hostage, had a child. The name of the child is unknown.\n",

Argentinian con-artist Sofia Davila posted raunchy pictures or herself online and then flirted with unsuspecting men she had contacted on the social network, suggesting they meet up for sex. But after meeting her victims, the 21-year-old from Buenos Aires, would spike their drinks and wait for them to fall unconscious, before ransacking their homes. Buenos Aires thief Sofia Davila, 21, would start chatting to men over Facebook before suggesting that they meet up. When they did, she would spike their drinks and rob their homes after they fell unconscious . The 21-year-old posted raunchy pictures of herself on Facebook and flirt with strangers she added on the network. She was caught after trying to trick police that she was an innocent bystanders in the robberies . Diego Escalante, from Tigre, Buenos Aires, said he had been robbed after falling victim to the ploy. The 39-year-old said: 'We had been flirting with each other for about two weeks and then she suggested we get together. 'We went to a hotel and had a good time and when she suggested we meet again I didn't think anything was suspicious. 'The next time we met she came to my place and said she'd like to drink her own alcohol and poured me one too. I then began to fill ill and passed out. 'When I woke up my feet and hands were tied and there were two men in my flat taking my TV, stereo and other things.' After carrying out the ruse Davila went to the police station herself to report the robbery - claiming she had been forced to leave the flat by the men, and had been powerless to stop them. The thief has been nicknamed the 'Black Widow of Facebook'. She is now awaiting trial after admitting tricking 15 men and robbing them. Two of her accomplices will also appear in court over the crimes . But a spokesman for the police said they were suspicious, having received numerous calls from men who had been stolen from after they spent the night with a woman they met over the internet . He said: 'The problem with her statement was that we had already received a dozen complaints from other men saying they had been robbed after meeting a woman over Facebook. 'This was the first time the woman had actually shown up herself though, but because she matched the description we already had we decided to hold her for questioning. One of Davila's victims said the pair hit it off at a hotel, and he didn't think have any suspicions when they met up again at his home. He said she drugged him and he woke up with his feet tied and two men stealing his TV . 'As soon as we spoke to the victim we knew she was the woman behind the robberies and it only took a little while before we had a full confession. We also found that the man had been drugged.' Davila admitted to bedding and robbing more than 15 men and is now awaiting trial along with her two accomplices. Argentinian news website DiarioVeloz.com said Davila, who worked in PR for a bowling alley, told police she was forced to commit the crimes to pay off her debts to a drug dealer .\n",

            "required :  As Australian Fashion Week comes to a close, a new damning report has named and shamed some of the worst clothing brands sold in Australia and their companies, for the ongoing exploitation of their overseas workers. Lowes, Industrie, Best & Less and the Just Group - which includes Just Jeans, Portmans and Dotti - were identified as some of the worst performing companies by The 2015 Australian Fashion Report. Amongst the best performers were Etiko, Audrey Blue, Cotton On, H&M and Zara. The report assessed the labour rights management systems of 59 companies and 219 brands operating in Australia. The 2015 Australian Fashion Report has named and shamed some of the worst Aussie clothing brands and companies for their ongoing exploitation of overseas workers . Amongst the best performers were Etiko, Audrey Blue, Cotton On, H&M and Zara . It found that only two of the companies could prove they were paying a full living wage to the workers in two of the three production stages of their clothing. None of the 59 companies could prove the workers at their raw material suppliers were paid a living wage. Unlike a country's legally set minimum wage, a living wage ensures that an employee has enough money to cover the necessities - like food, water, electricity and shelter - and still has a little left over for themselves and their dependants. In some countries like Bangladesh, where the minimum wage is as little as US$68 a month and a living wage is US$104, the difference can be made by paying each worker just an additional 30c per t-shirt. Lowes, Industrie, Best & Less and the Just Group - which includes Just Jeans, Portmans and Dotti - were identified as some of the worst performers . 'The whole point in our reporting scorecard is if these companies don't have rigours systems in place to mitigate against those risks then you can't be sure that there is no forced labour or child labour in their supply chain,' Gershon Nimbalker, an advocacy manager at Baptist World Aid, said . 'A mere 12 per cent of companies could demonstrate any action towards paying wages above the legal minimum, and even then, only for part of their supply chain,' the report states. 'Furthermore, 91 per cent of companies still don't know where all their cotton comes from and 75 per cent don't know the source of all their fabrics and inputs. 'If companies don't know how and where their products are made, then there's no way for them to ensure that their workers are protected.' Uzbekistan for instance, the world's fifth largest exporter of cotton, was notorious for its  child labour policies which saw children as young as 10 forced to work in the fields until the government recently  improved conditions by renouncing the use of child labour 'on a systematic basis'. 'Furthermore, 91 per cent of companies still don't know where all their cotton comes from and 75 per cent don't know the source of all their fabrics and inputs,' the report stated . Gershon Nimbalker, an advocacy manager at Baptist World Aid told Daily Mail Australia that part of the motivation behind the report was to shed light on how many of the world's 165 million children involved in child labour were employed by the fashion industry. 'The whole point in our reporting scorecard is if these companies don't have rigours systems in place to mitigate against those risks then you can't be sure that there is no forced labour or child labour in their supply chain,' he said. 'There were 61 assessment criteria that we used to grade the companies that were put together with lots of collaboration with international labour rights organisations. 'We found all the public information available on the companies - public statements, anything online - and compiled and assessed it before sending a copy to the company and asking for feedback or asking them to tell us what we missed. The report comes almost two years after over 1,100 Bangladeshi garment workers died when the Rana Plaza factory collapsed in Bangladesh due to building safety problems . 'We found all the public information available on the companies - public statements, anything online - and compiled and assessed it before sending a copy to the company and asking for feedback or asking them to tell us what we missed. 'The worst grades basically mean that they have very little public information available about what they're doing to protect workers and on top of that that they haven't engaged with our research process. About 75 per cent did engage, but one quarter didn't.' However the report also noted some progress in the industry with companies like Kmart and Cotton On improving their transparency by identifying their suppliers, and H&M, Zara, Country Road and the Sussan Group showing attempts to improve their international worker's pay.\n",

            "required :  Tragedy: Prasanna ‘Nick’ Arulchelvam died when he fell from a van while chasing a gang of thieves . A courageous shopkeeper was killed when he made a desperate attempt to stop a gang of thieves who had broken into his van in a cash and carry car park. Prasanna ‘Nick’ Arulchelvam ran and jumped through an open side door of their van, but was pushed out and hit the ground as the vehicle sped away. A customer in the Costco car park in Watford where the incident happened reported hearing a ‘nasty crunch’ as the 34-year-old’s head hit the ground. Today, the man who pushed Mr Prasanna to his death was jailed for 11 years after admitting all he wanted was ‘a few cheap packets of cigarettes’. Mr Prasanna had just finished his purchases when he returned to his silver Transit van and loaded a large box containing 21 smaller boxes of cigarettes in his van. He took his trolley back to a bay and returned to see that the stock he had bought had been disturbed, Luton Crown Court heard. Mr Prasanna then gave chase as he saw a separate van speeding off. Prosecutor John Price QC said: ‘Mr Prasanna courageously acted in an attempt to stop the driver getting away. ‘With equal determination and with an utterly callous regard for his safety, the two men used violence that cost this man his life. ‘Mr Prasanna was forced out but managed to hold onto the side of the vehicle before the door was shut and he fell to the ground.’ A witness said it was as if he had been pushed or kicked away from the van. Nothing had been taken from Mr Prasanna’s van. Last October cousins Patrick and James O’Driscoll were handed jail terms of ten-and-a-half years and seven-and-a-half years after pleading guilty to the manslaughter of Mr Prasanna. The sentence of Patrick O’Driscoll, who was driving the van, was later increased to 12 years on appeal. His cousin was in another vehicle at the scene while a third man, Michael McInerney, 34, was in the rear of the van Mr Prasanna chased. McInerney went on the run after he was arrested in December 2013 and bailed. A European Arrest Warrant was issued but he was arrested in Corby, Northamptonshire in December 2014. Today he was jailed for a total of 11 years - ten-and-a-half years for manslaughter, two years concurrent for conspiracy to steal, with six months consecutive from the suspended sentence. Defence barrister Henry Hughes said the father of three accepts responsibility for the death of a man who deserved no harm at all. Jailed: Michael McInerney was handed an 11 year sentence after admitting to pushing Mr Prasanna . ‘He will live with the horror of the consequences of his actions for the rest of his life. He wanted no more than a few cheap packets of cigarettes,’ he said. Judge Michael Kay QC told McInerney: ‘Mr Prasanna was a hard working man and a family man with a wife and two-and-a-half-year-old son. He is described as a devoted and very loving father and husband. ‘I can’t help but compare Mr Prasanna who was a hard-working and lawful citizen with you. What example are you setting to your three children? “ . ‘You applied violence to get Mr Prasanna off the vehicle. You pushed him out of the vehicle which began the chain of events that led to his death.’ McInerney, from Borehamwood, Hertforshire, who was living at the time in Radwell, Bedforshire, appeared via a video link from Woodhill Prison, Milton Keynes. At an earlier hearing he pleaded not guilty to murder and not guilty to conspiracy to rob. His pleas of guilty to alternative charges of manslaughter and conspiracy to steal were accepted by the prosecution. He had 17 convictions for 32 offences and operated with alias names and false dates of birth. At the time Mr Prasanna was attacked, McInerney was serving a seven month suspended sentence suspended for 15 months for a similar theft from a motor vehicle at a cash and carry in Sheerness, in which a man who tried to stop him fell into the road. The day before Mr Prasanna was killed, the two O’Driscolls had carried out thefts and attempted thefts at Booker cash and carry stores in Dagenham, Chelmsford, Colchester and Ipswich. On the Sunday they drove to Radwell and collected McInerney. The Costco in Watford where three men - cousins Patrick and James O’Driscoll and Michael McInerney - tried to grab cigarettes from Mr Prasanna's van before speeding off in separate vehicles. All have now been jailed . In two vans they went to three sites, where they stole or attempted to steal from customers at Bookers in Bedford and Luton and at PC World at the Staples Retail Park in Hendon, before going to Costco in Watford. Mr Prasanna died on June 6 2013 in St Mary’s Hospital in London, 11 days after the attack on him. He came to England from Sri Lanka in 1998 and worked for Tesco as a manager. Mr Prasanna later opened his own shop in Basingstoke, Hampshire, with his younger brother Uday. They opened another store in Sittingbourne, Kent, and were looking at starting a third Southampton. Four years ago he married Shayanthy, 30, and the couple lived in Grandfield Avenue, Watford with their young son.\n",

            "required :  (CNN)A fiery sunset greeted people in Washington Sunday. The deep reddish color caught Seattle native Tim Durkan's eye. He photographed a handful of aerial shots of the sunset warming the city's skyline and shared them on CNN iReport. The stunning sunsets were the result of raging wildfires in parts of Siberia. \"The dramatic sunsets began showing up over the weekend and had Seattle locals wondering where the amber-colored haze was originating from,\" Durken said. The fires were started in southeastern Siberia, by farmers burning grass in their fields. But on April 14, it is believed that the flames quickly grew out of control because of strong winds and spread throughout the region, according to CNN affiliate KOMO-TV. As a result, the fires have destroyed dozens of villages in the region. Rescue crews were able to put out the flames. However, the lingering smoke from the widespread fires were picked up by atmospheric winds. The winds carried the smoke from Siberia across the Pacific Ocean and brought it to the Pacific Northwest. Parts of Oregon, Washington and British Columbia are seeing the results of the smoke, wind and solar light combination. The reason people are seeing an intense red sunset is a result of smoke particles filtering out the shorter wavelength colors from the sunlight like greens, blues, yellows and purples, KOMO-TV said. That means colors like red and orange are able to penetrate the air unfiltered. The colors are especially intense during sunrises and sunsets because there is more atmosphere for the light to travel through to get to a person's eye. As the smoke starts to dissipate, air quality will get better and these fiery sunsets will lose their reddish hue.\n",

They believe the camel - the first intact camel skeleton found in central Europe - may have been left in the town of Tulln for trading after the siege of Vienna in 1683. In a country where cows dominate the rural landscape, the discovery in an Austrian cellar shocked scientists. The researchers described it as a 'sunken ship in the desert'. Archaeologists have uncovered the complete skeleton of an 'alien' 17th-century camel that was likely used in the second Ottoman-Habsburg war. They believe the camel - the first intact camel skeleton found in central Europe - may have been left in the town of Tulln for trading after the siege of Vienna in 1683 . Genetic analysis of the beast show that it was a Bactrian-dromedary hybrid – a breed popular in the Ottoman army at the time. 'The partly excavated skeleton was at first suspected to be a large horse or cattle,' said Alfred Galik, a researcher at the University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna. 'But one look at the cervical vertebrae, the lower jaw and the metacarpal bones immediately revealed that this was a camel.' The camel was male, around seven years old and most likely castrated. The camel was male, around seven years old and most likely castrated. Along with DNA evidence, the shape of the animal's skull indicated it was a hybrid . The cross-breed camel had been most likely used as a riding and transport animal by the Ottoman army during the Siege of Vienna in 1683. Pictured are various views of the camel's metacarpus, which is part of its legs . The battle that took place on 11 September 1683 after Vienna had been seiged by the Ottoman Empire for two months.

Historians claim the battle marked the turning-point in the Ottoman–Habsburg wars, a 300-year struggle between the Holy Roman Empire and the Ottoman Empire . The loot that fell into the hands of the Holy League troops and the Viennese was large. King John Sobieski vividly described in a letter to his wife a few days after the battle: . 'Ours are treasures unheard of... tents, sheep, cattle and no small number of camels... it is victory as nobody ever knew before.' Galik and his team also said the cross-breed camel had been most likely used as a riding and transport animal by the Ottoman army during the Siege of Vienna in 1683. The remarkable find was made during an archaeological dig that took place amid preparations for a new shopping centre in the town. If modern-day scientists were stumped by the find, it would have been an even greater shock for residents of 17th-century Tulln. 'The animal was certainly exotic for the people of Tulln. They probably didn't know what to feed it or whether one could eat it,' Galik said. While Roman-era camel bones occasionally surface in Austria, Serbia and Belgium, the Tulln discovery was the first complete camel skeleton to emerge in Central Europe. 'This means that the animal was not killed and then butchered. It may have been acquired as part of an exchange,' said Galik .

            "required :  (CNN)Would you want a TV program about your family history to include details of a distant, long-deceased relative who had owned slaves? Seriously, who in their right mind would want to be tarnished by the sins of an ancestor you had no connection to other than a remote bloodline? I wouldn't, and neither did Ben Affleck, who lobbied producers of a PBS show, \"Finding Your Roots,\" to remove any reference to his great-great-great grandfather Benjamin Cole, a Georgia slave owner in the mid-1800's, in an episode that looked at Affleck's family history. (Affleck revealed Cole's name Wednesday night.) Here's the thing that might surprise many, given the tendency of the media to exploit any potentially scandalous material: The show's producer, Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr., apparently acquiesced to Affleck's request, because when the episode aired in October 2014, there was no mention of the star's slave-owning ancestor. Affleck's attempt to alter the content of the program only publicly became known a few days ago after WikiLeaks released hacked emails revealing an exchange between Gates and Sony Pictures chief Michael Lynton. When Gates asked how he should respond to Affleck's request to delete the material, Lynton responded, \"all things being equal, I would definitely take it out.\" And on Tuesday, Affleck, via Facebook, admitted that he had urged Gates to excise any reference to his slave-owning relative. Affleck explained, \"I didn't want any television show about my family to include a guy who owned slaves. I was embarrassed. The very thought left a bad taste in my mouth.\" Now Gates has publicly denied that he made his decision about the content of the program based on Affleck's request, but it seems likely that he did. After all, Affleck noted as much in his Facebook post, writing that Gates \"agreed with me on the slave owner but made other choices I disagreed with.\" And three other celebrities profiled on the series last season were shown to have been related to slave owners. So it's unlikely that it was simply happenstance that it left out any reference to Affleck's familial slave ownership connection. In any event, PBS has launched an internal review to determine if the show violated its own editorial standards. Whatever the results of the review, Affleck and Gates did the right thing. Let's be clear: \"Finding Your Roots\" is not an investigative news show; it's an entertainment program. In fact, as Affleck noted, much of the material is provided directly by the celebrity being profiled. It's not \"60 Minutes\" but more in the nature of a sophisticated profile of celebrities, using their marquee names to attract viewers. There's not even a hint that Affleck strong-armed the producers or made any type of threats against them if they included the information. In the emails between Gates and Lynton, which they presumably believed at the time were confidential and would remain so, there was no mention of undue pressure by Affleck. Instead, Gates simply noted that Affleck  \"asked us to edit out something.\" After the emails were revealed, Gates issued a statement, saying, \"Ultimately, I maintain editorial control on all of my projects and, with my producers, decide what will make for the most compelling program. In the case of Mr. Affleck we focused on what we felt were the most interesting aspects of his ancestry -- including a Revolutionary War ancestor, a third great-grandfather who was an occult enthusiast, and his mother who marched for civil rights during the Freedom Summer of 1964.\" My view would be different if Affleck had a history of uttering racist remarks or engaging in racist conduct. That would have made the information truly newsworthy. But instead we have a man known for championing progressive causes, which I'm sure made him even more acutely sensitive that some on the right might possibly use this information against him in the future. Perhaps that's what Affleck meant in his Facebook post when he wrote that this information made him feel \"vulnerable.\" Affleck has noted that he regrets asking PBS to not include information about his \"distant relative.\"  That's a nice gesture, but it was not needed. Affleck had every right to ask for the information about a long-deceased distant relative to be left out of the show. And PBS had the choice to include it or leave it out. I applaud PBS for doing the right thing at a time when media outlets rarely show any restraint on the lives of people in the public eye.\n",

            "required :  Wanted: A police e-fit image of millionaire people trafficker Ermias Ghermay, who is thought to have made £72m with his accomplice Mered Medhanie from smuggling migrants in the last two years . Two millionaire people traffickers have been heard mocking the migrant boat disasters that have resulted in thousands of deaths in the Mediterranean, it has been reported. One of them, an Eritrean called Mered Medhanie, also known as The General, was heard laughing on a police wiretap about overloading migrant ships, a problem that causes them to capsize. Medhanie, 34, who is based in the Libyan capital of Tripoli, is said to have boasted: 'They say I put too many aboard, but they're the ones who want to leave in a hurry.' A second trafficker, Ermias Ghermay, who is thought to have made £72million with Medhanie from smuggling in the last two years, also showed callous disregard for the plight of his 'customers'. He was heard declaring last summer: 'They organised another trip a few days ago. I don't know what happened – they probably died.' Ghermay, who also lives in Tripoli, was already wanted on an arrest warrant in connection with an October 2013 capsizing off Lampedusa that left 366 dead. Reports of the conversations come just days after at least 900 people were feared to have drowned in one of the worst maritime disasters since the end of World War Two. More than 1,700 have perished in the last week alone. Italian police yesterday released Ghermay's photofit as they sought to track down the pair, who are among several traffickers wanted in connection with a major human smuggling ring. Ghermay and Medhanie are currently living undisturbed in Tripoli, exploiting the lawlessness in the collapse state which has allowed smugglers to operate with impunity since the fall of Gaddafi. Medhanie, who reportedly compares himself to the former Libyan dictator, and his accomplice enjoy the protection of local law authorities in the capital after it was taken over by a rival Islamist faction. A Italian naval officer stands in front of rescued migrants on board the Italian Navy vessel Bettica as they arrive in the Sicilian harbour of Augusta after being the latest group to be rescued from the Mediterranean . Terrified: Boys embrace as they arrive with migrants at the Sicilian harbor of Augusta with the Italian navy . In another wire tap recording, Medhanie, who is thought to have a wife and child in Sweden, is heard expressing scant regard for migrant suffering. 'We do an illegal job – but what do you expect? We're not the government,' he says, according to La Stampa as reported by The Independent. Others reveal how his business is booming, with him heard to say: 'This year I've done well – I sent off 7,000 to 8,000.' Another intercept reveals a discussion between Medhanie and his accomplices in Italy about the possibility of setting up bank accounts in the United Arab Emirates, but opting for U.S. or Canadian banks because 'they don't ask you where the money comes from.' Safe: European governments came under increasing pressure to tackle the Mediterranean's migrant crisis ahead of a summit as harrowing details emerged of the fate of hundreds who died over the weekend . Rescued migrants wait to disembark from the Italian Navy vessel Bettica  in the Sicilian harbour of Augusta . Barbaric human traffickers are separating migrants by race, locking those with the darkest skin below deck where death is inevitable if the boat sinks, survivors have told. Teenagers arriving on the Italian island of Lampedusa told how passengers from sub-Saharan Africa were placed in the hold with no water, sunlight or, crucially, means of escape. One boy from Somalia told aid workers from Save The Children: 'The Libyans who got me to Italy are not human. 'They pushed eight Nigerians into the sea. They all drowned.' Conversely, Yusuf, a 17-year-old Palestinian boy who fled Gaza for Italy in February, said he was placed on an upper level with other people from the Middle East, it was reported by The Independent. Police in Palermo arrested 15 people on Monday in connection with a smuggling ring they say was masterminded by Ghermay. Prosecutors say the network had generated transactions worth hundreds of thousands of euros criss-crossing Europe as migrants paid not only to cross the Mediterranean but also to join relatives in northern Europe. Prosecutor Maurizio Scalia said based on telephone intercepts, the average cost to smuggle a migrant from Eritrea or Ethiopia to Libya ran $4,000 to $5,000, while the crossing to Italy cost an additional $1,000 to $1,500. Migrants pay hundreds of dollars more to get out of holding centers and at least another $1,000 to travel to northern Europe. Payments for each leg are made up front, often using the Islamic hawala banking system which is based on an informal honour code in which a relative in northern Europe pays a local broker. The payment information is then transmitted to the actual traffickers on the ground advising them that the leg has been paid for. European governments were today under mounting pressure to act decisively on the Mediterranean migrant crisis as harrowing details emerged of the fate of those who died in the worst tragedy to date. With the crisis set to be discussed at an emergency summit on Thursday, allegations of callous disregard for Arab and African lives are pushing EU leaders to respond to a disaster in which 800 people are feared to have died in appalling circumstances off the coast of Libya on Sunday.

A police handout showing Mohammed Ali Malek (left) and Mahmud Bikhit (right) after their arrest in Malta . The vast majority of those on board were locked in the hold or the middle deck of the 20-metre (66-foot) boat when it capsized following a collision with a Portuguese cargo ship responding to its distress signal. Only 28, including two crew members who have been arrested, survived and 24 bodies have been recovered. Survivors have described the moment the doomed ship sank, telling how how they clung to dead bodies in the pitch black sea in order to stay afloat. They also accused the captain of being drunk moments before he rammed another ship, causing the tragedy. Bangladeshi Riajul Islam, 17, said the only reason he survived was because he was on the top deck and knew how to swim. Nasir Khan, a fellow 17-year-old Bangladeshi, said he was also on the top deck and lived by clinging on to a life vest. The stricken boat initially set off from Egypt and then stopped off on the Libyan coast near the city Zuwarah to pick up more passengers, it has been reported. It set off from Libya on Saturday and sent out a distress signal shortly before midnight 120 miles south of the Italian island of Lampedusa. It later capsized.\n",

But yesterday the underemployed 26-year-old was spotted enjoying the high life in an overseas location yet again, this time at the Bahrain Grand Prix . She was in the Gulf state, ruled by a controversial king whose regime has been accused of violently repressing pro-democracy activists, with her long-term boyfriend Dave Clark, according to an onlooker who saw her among dignitaries on the starting grid before the race. ‘She was walking behind the Crown Prince of Bahrain. She was introduced to the recently abdicated King Carlos of Spain and curtseyed,’ the source said. ‘Bernie Ecclestone was leading that group of dignitaries. I think she watched the race from the tower high above the circuit with the Crown Prince.’ It is thought legendary Formula 1 racing driver Sir Jackie Stewart and comedian Rory Bremner were also among those in the tower enjoying the spectacular view as Britain’s Lewis Hamilton won after battling it out over the 57 laps of the 192 mile race with arch rivals Sebastian Vettel and Nico Rosberg. Although Beatrice receives no public funding, her jet-set lifestyle has raised eyebrows at a time when the Queen is keen to promote royal thriftiness. Asked about the sighting of Beatrice at the Bahrain Grand Prix, a Buckingham Palace spokesman last night(sun) said: ‘No comment.’ The 26-year-old princess (pictured left in Beijing in November last year) was spotted in the Gulf state with her long-term boyfriend Dave Clark, according to an onlooker . According to the witness, Beatrice (pictured celebrating New Year in the Caribbean) was with the Crown Prince, whose regime has been accused of violently putting down pro-democracy protests .

She also squeezed in three trips to her parents’ £13million chalet in Verbier, Switzerland. Last month she flew to New York to celebrate sister Eugenie’s 25th birthday. It was Beatrice’s third US jaunt this year alone. She had already been spotted in New York in January before hitting the ski slopes of Aspen, Colorado, the following month. She also recently also had a long weekend with friends in Greece.

U.S. Attorney Ronald Machen, on his last day in office, told House Speaker John Boehner in a seven-page letter that Lerner could wrap herself in the U.S. Constitution's Fifth Amendment, even though she offered a self-serving opening statement before clamming up during a May 22, 2013 hearing. Lerner has long been in the GOP's crosshairs because she led the IRS department tasked with approving nonprofit groups' applications for tax-exempt status. Beginning in 2010, the department gave conservative groups with words like 'patriots' or 'tea party' in their names extra scrutiny, slow-walking their applications and keping many in limbo for years. The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee had subpoenaed Lerner after she refused to testify voluntarily about her role in the scandal.

UNLESS I'M TAKING THE FIFTH: Former IRS official Lois Lerner insisted on her innocence in an opening statement during a 2013 congressional hearing, and then refused to answer lawmakers' questions – a choice that the Obama administration now says was perfectly legal . U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Ronald Machen (left) dropped his bomb on Congress just one day before leaving office to return to private legal practice . Emailed? Machen's letter was addressed to House Speaker John Boehner (left), who was in Jerusalem visiting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (right) When she refused again to answer questions during a second hearing on March 5, 2014, House Republicans prepared a criminal contempt citation and referred the case to the Justice Department once it was approved. California Republican Rep. Darrell Issa, then the Oversight committee's chairman, told Lerner in one hearing that she had 'effectively waived your rights' by defending herself under oath. 'I have not done anything wrong,' Lerner had said in the 2013 hearing. 'I have not broken any laws, I have not violated any IRS rules or regulations, and I have not provided false information to this or any other congressional committee.' Machen told Boehner on Tuesday that since Lerner had only made 'general claims of innocence,' she was within her rights to refuse to answer questions. 'Ms. Lemer's general denials of wrongdoing did not amount to \"testimony\" about the actual facts under the Committee's review,' he said. 'The Fiflh Amendment to the Constitution would provide Ms. Lerner with an absolute defense, should she be prosecuted ,,, for her refusal to testify.' Machen's March 31 letter arrived on Capitol Hill just a day before his resignation took effect after a five-year stint as Washington, D.C.'s top federal prosecutor inside the Justice Department. President Barack Obama named him to his post in December 2009. Reactions swept through the nation's capital as word spread that Lerner was, legally, in the clear. 'Once again, the Obama administration has tried to sweep IRS targeting of taxpayers for their political beliefs under the rug,' Boehner spokesman Michael Steel told Daily Mail Online. 'But unaccountable federal bureaucrats using their power to attack the First Amendment strikes at the heart of our democracy, and the American people deserve the truth.' 'The White House,' said Steel, 'still has the opportunity to do the right thing and appoint a special counsel to examine the IRS’ actions.' Attorney General Eric Holder has refused repeatedly to bring in a special counsel, instead appointing attorney Barbara Bosserman to lead an internal probe. Republicans see Bosserman as a politically conflicted choice: Federal Election Commission records show that she donated a total of $6,750 to  Obama’s campaigns and to the Democratic National Committee. SWITCH: During the tea party targeting hearings, it was Oversight committee ranking Democrat Elijah Cummings (left) who was regularly exasperated – but now Darrell Issa (right), his Republican foil at the time is frustrated by a lack of accountability for Lerner . Tea party groups and other conservative organizations seeking tax-exempt status were kept in limbo for years while the IRS often green-lighted liberal groups in weeks or months . Issa, whose outrage led to the congressional contempt citation against Lerner – and one against Holder, for refusing to turn over documents related to the scandal – was livid. 'Refusing to prosecute Mrs. Lerner and Mr. Holder after they were held in contempt by a vote of the House of Representatives sends a disturbing message that it is permissible for senior government officials to lie to Congress and to ignore subpoenas for information vital to Congressional investigations,' he said Wednesday in a statement. Issa's successor as chairman of the Oversight committee, Utah Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz, said Machen's letter 'exhibits a disregard for the rule of law' and scoffed at his objectivity. 'It is unclear whether the Administration directed Mr. Machen not to prosecute Lois Lerner, or whether he was motivated by an ideological kinship with IRS’s leadership,' Chaffetz said. 'The Committee will continue to pursue its ongoing investigation into the targeting of American citizens based on their political beliefs. Our goal is to ensure that the people responsible, including Lois Lerner, are held accountable.' Lerner's attorney, William Taylor, said in a statement that his client 'looks forward to moving on with her life.' 'It is unfortunate that the majority party in the House put politics before a citizen's constitutional rights,' Taylor said. DOJ Letter to Boehner About Lois Lerner uploaded by DailyMail.com .\n",

            "required :  Washington (CNN)ISIS is a problem that is \"off the charts historically\" and has sent the United States into \"uncharted territory\" when it comes to putting down the terror group, the Obama administration's point man in the fight recently told CNN. The comments, which Brett McGurk made in an exclusive interview, were some of the administration's strongest to date in describing the challenge the United States and its allies face in battling ISIS. \"This is a problem that is off the charts historically,\" he said, referring to the more than 20,000 foreign fighters who have gone into Syria. \"Just put that into perspective: It's about twice the number that went into Afghanistan in the 1980s over a 10-year period to fight the Soviet Union, and those came really from only a handful of countries.\" He concluded, \"We're in unchartered territory here.\" McGurk just returned from an urgent summit of coalition nations held in Jordan. Last week, Canada became the latest nation to conduct airstrikes against ISIS over Syria. The United States now lists 62 countries in the coalition. As the U.S.-led coalition has focused attention on Iraq and Syria, ISIS has expanded its reach to Libya, Egypt and Yemen, often with existing extremist groups pledging allegiance to the militants. McGurk did not rule out expanding U.S. military action beyond Iraq and Syria to combat the increasing regional threat. \"We have a lot of tools to protect ourselves and our national security interests, some of which are military tools,\" he said. \"Of course we apply those tools when the president determines and our chain of command makes the recommendation that that is the right thing to do.\" The United States has also been stepping up efforts to involve Sunni groups in the fight against ISIS. To date, that involvement has been extremely limited as Sunni tribes see Shiite militias, many with horrendous human rights records, take the lead. But McGurk said that Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi is making progress getting Sunni tribes to support a planned Iraqi offensive against ISIS in Anbar province in the coming weeks. He stressed the importance of working with al-Abadi, noting that the Iraqi leader was in Anbar province last week handing out more than 1,000 AK-47s to tribal fighters who are going to join the Iraqi security forces. \"We are helping to enable and train (them) as they begin to go on the offensive over the coming weeks and months in Anbar,\" McGurk said. \"They put out this very perverse, twisted vision, and it's very attractive to a lot of young men around the world,\" he acknowledged. \"But in fact, what the foreign fighters are finding in Syria and Iraq is that they're more likely to get killed in Iraq and Syria, and in fact, instead of getting a slave bride as ISIS leaders promise them, they're more likely to get killed by a female Peshmerga fighter in the streets of Kobani.\" That bottom line, he assessed, could turn the tide: \"The foreign fighters are learning the reality of what it's like when they go to join this twisted version of a caliphate, and I think we're going to see those networks begin to dry up.\"\n",

David Cameron - who has been accused of trying to hide his bald spot - has been secretly using hair dye to turn back the years, Nigel Farage suggested today . He added: ‘Any man who can reverse the greying process I’m jealous of. ‘I’m going to have a go myself, it’s a wonderful thing.

Some people it worries to death and others really don’t worry too much.’ Mr Cameron, 48, has previously been accused of visiting stylists and even trichologists to keep his hair looking youthful. In 2011, Downing Street was forced to deny claims Mr Cameron was fighting the relentless process with unnatural help after his grey hairs looked less prominent, . ‘I promise you he has not dyed his hair,’ a spokesman said. ‘The Prime Minister has other things to think about, he’s just not like that.’ Mr Farage said he was ‘jealous’ of how the Tory leader has reversed the greying process while in Downing Street .

Jamyra Gallmon, 21, has been charged with first-degree murder while armed for allegedly killing David Messerschmitt, 30, on February 9 in Washington, D.C. The woman admitted to police that she set up the lawyer using a masculine-sounding email address and went to the upscale Donovan hotel with the intention of robbing him. Scroll down for video . Jamyra Gallmon, 21, (pictured graduating from her military academy high school) has been charged with first-degree felony murder while armed for allegedly stabbing to death 30-year-old David Messerschmitt on February 9 . David Messerschmitt (pictured with his wife Kim) was found dead in his DC hotel room in February. An affidavit revealed on Thursday that he had been soliciting sex from men through Craigslist . According to Gallmon, who was seen on surveillance camera entering the hotel wearing androgynous clothing including black boots, black pants and a black hooded jacket, the room door was open when she arrived. The affidavit stated that the pair got into a struggle and the defendant pulled a knife from her pants and stabbed the victim repeatedly until he fell to the floor where she stabbed him several more times. The victim was found with multiple stab wounds to the back, groin and abdomen along with one wound which pierced his heart and another which hit his spinal cord. His hands had been bound with zip-ties into a pair of makeshift cuffs. His hands were covered in defensive wounds. Messerschmitt had texted his wife Kim Vuong at 7.45pm on February 9 to tell her he would be home in an hour after leaving his law office. He never returned and the next day he was found dead at his hotel room with 'various credit cards strewn about'. He death was declared a homicide. Among the  items recovered from the room were a computer, lubricant, condoms, cell phone and enema kit, Fox DC reported. Fingerprints were also found in the room. Investigators discovered that Messerschmitt had posted a Craigslist ad on February 9, soliciting responses from other men, using 'dcguy456'. The lawyer began an exchange with an individual, using the name 'chrissanchez0906', around 2pm which continued throughout the day. Messerschmitt told the individual his room number at the hotel and gave a meeting time of 7pm - 7.30pm. The email address that the lawyer had been in contact with was linked to Gallmon. On a search of the woman's DC apartment, police found a knife, black boots and gloves, and a pack of zip ties. A discussion in the comments section of a Queerty.com article about Mr Messerschmitt's murder in February included users referencing interactions with an individual using the handle 'dcguy456'. One commenter said that 'dcguy456' had previously posted on the 'M4M' (men for men) section of Craigslist and identified himself as bisexual. Another individual's post claimed that he had exchanged emails with 'dcguy456'and met up with him several years ago.

Her mother told NBC that her daughter had never been in trouble before and had an ambition to join the military. Coach and teacher, Vincent McDuffie, told the station that she had wanted to play basketball in college but had suffered a knee injury. He said that her supportive family always turned up to watch her high school games. According to the police report, Messerchmitt left his work at law film, DLA Piper, around 5.30pm on February 9 and texted his wife a couple of hours later to say he would back at their Capitol Hill home in an hour. The couple reportedly had not seen each other since February 8, but Vuong didn't think anything seemed wrong with her husband. She reported him missing at midnight, saying it was unlike him to disappear and that usually he got home before her. Messerschmitt was found dead in his room the next day and pronounced dead at the scene. Authorities  have arrested a Washington, DC woman named Jamyra Gallmon for the crime.

            "required :  Notorious mass murderer Peter Sutcliffe, who has spent three decades in jail, is to be moved to a cushy low security unit, it has been claimed . The families of victims of Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe are furious at plans to move him from Broadmoor to a low-security Priory unit. Mass murderer Sutcliffe has spent more than three decades in Broadmoor for the savage killings of 13 women. But now, despite being one of the country’s most notorious serial killers, Sutcliffe may be moved to a cushy Priory unit set in Berkshire woodland. Sutcliffe is being lined up for the move after he expressed remorse and said he no longer hears the 'voices from God' which he had blamed for his killing spree at his 1981 trial. A report is being compiled which will be heard next month at a prison tribunal which will rule if the move goes ahead. But families of his victims are furious about the move. Neil Jackson, whose mother Emily, 46, became the Ripper's second victim in 1976, told the Sun: 'He should not be moved at all. 'As he's in Broadmoor, he should stay there and they should throw away the key. This just rubs salt into the wounds of families and I believe any remorse he has shown is fake.' A source at the prison told the newspaper Sutcliffe was optimistic about the move - despite being previously turned down for a transfer to the unit which boasts facilities such as a fully-fitted gym and music room. Plans of his referral follow allegations earlier this year that Sutcliffe, who used weapons including a hammer, screwdriver and knives to mutilate women across the north of England, was enjoying an easy lifestyle in jail. Scroll down for video . Potential plans to move Britain's most notorious mass murderer from the high security Broadmoor prison hospital to the Priory . Hospital: Broadmoor's corridors look ordinary, but it houses some of Britain's most disturbed individuals . He was said to be eating chocolate, watching television and listening to music, as well as being privileged to receive visitors four days a week who can stay for up to four hours. It was claimed he is also given money to spend in the psychiatric hospital’s shop, and attends a ceramics workshop and twice-weekly Bible studies sessions. It has been claimed that Sutcliffe is now a Jehovah’s Witness and was even given a baptism. In the evenings, he watches TV shows such as The X Factor and I’m A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!, the Sun on Sunday reported. A new image of a relaxed-looking Sutcliffe – the first for 20 years – supports the cushy lifestyle claim. There has been little change to his distinctive appearance apart from an increase in weight and the greying of his hair and beard. He had ballooned with some reports estimating his weight at 19 or 20 stone, which is said to be down to a love of chocolate and burgers, and now sufferers from type 2 diabetes. Sutcliffe is currently said to enjoy a cushy lifestyle in Broadmoor eating chocolate, watching television and listening to music, it was claimed . The Priory Thornford Park set in Berkshire woodland . While officials refused to comment on the move, it is thought that Sutcliffe would be transferred to a unit such as the Priory Thornford Park. Based just 30 miles from Broadmoor, it is set in Berkshire woodland and offers a fully equipped gym and running track, a music room and occupational therapy suite. A 'rehab kitchen' and computer  and education rooms are also amongst the high-end facilities at the unit. The red-brick building houses 122 men with mental illness, compared to Broadmoor's 210, with a combination of low and medium secure beds. Past residents include dangerous criminal John Maguir, convicted for assault, who escaped by scaling a wall and child sex abuser Peter Pickering. Its website states its users are 'among the most vulnerable members of society and require sensitive therapeutic interventions delivered in a healing environment that encourages self-awareness, knowledge and empowerment.' The full list of facilities include: . The former trucker, who notoriously targeted prostitutes during his five-year killing spree, has seen his health deteriorate in recent years. He had a hernia operation in 2013 and was reported to have suffered a heart attack. The murderer, who is already blind in one eye after a prison attack, was also told  he could lose what remains of his sight within a year due to an eye condition. He had refused laser eye surgery as he fears it could cause him to lose his vision immediately. The claims about his lifestyle have angered victims’ families. Roofer Neil Jackson, 56, whose mother Emily was Sutcliffe’s second victim, said: ‘He tore apart our family and this just looks like he’s being rewarded. He’s getting an easy life and he’s clearly enjoying every minute. I hope the lifestyle kills him. ‘It doesn’t matter how many years go by, it doesn’t make the pain of what he did any easier.’ Peter Sutcliffe, the Yorkshire Ripper, after an attack by another prisoner in 1982 with a broken coffee jar . Sutcliffe has been in Broadmoor since he was given 20 life sentences in 1981. As well as the 13 women he killed, he tried to murder seven more in a five-year spree. The killer, who believed he was on a 'mission from God' to kill sex workers, was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia in 1984. He refused treatment until 1993, when the Mental Health Commission ruled that he should be given anti-psychotic medication forcibly. He has been attacked at least three times behind bars. The second assault put his right eye out and another inmate then unsuccessfully attempted to do the same for his left . It costs taxpayers more than £300,000 a year to detain him in Broadmoor, at least five times the cost of a prison cell. Last year his plea to be moved to a unit in his home county of West Yorkshire was rejected. In 2010, an appeal over his sentence that could have led to him applying for parole was rejected, with a High Court judge saying he should never be released. The Priory and the Prison Service declined to comment on the move while a spokeswoman for the Department of Health, which is responsible for the medical unit, said they would not comment on individual cases.\n",

            "required :  English essential: This laminated document announces the new ISIS nursing school and lists the language entry requirements for would-be nurses . Militants fighting for the Islamic State terror group in Syria have announced that all nurses working in areas under their control must speak English - something the NHS still hasn't introduced. Revealing plans to open a school of nursing in ISIS' de facto capital Raqqa, the extremists also disclosed the tough entry requirements for prospective medical workers. Among them are rules that applicants are no more than 25 years of age, must be willing to work anywhere inside the territory controlled by the extremists, and must speak fluent English. The latter rule is something that even the NHS has yet fully put in place, with nurses who trained in European countries still able to treat patients without any formal language checks thanks to bureaucratic rules barring the Nursing and Midwifery Council testing EU candidates. Details of the first nursing school to be opened in ISIS-held territory were revealed by on Twitter by Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently - an activist group based in the Syrian city that uses a network of brave informers to document the daily atrocities carried out by the Islamic extremists. RIBSS shared a photograph of a laminated document written in Arabic  giving details of the new medical school and listing the entry requirements for would-be nurses. It states that all candidates be aged between 18 and 25, pass an entry exam, impress during an interview, graduated from secondary school with science qualifications, be willing to travel to any ISIS-held area, and willing work for ISIS institutions for at least two years after graduating. The document also states the importance of English - saying candidates will not be accepted without knowing how to speak and understand the language. This is in stark contrast with Britain where English language checks for all nurses are still not being enforced, despite legislation being passed last month making them a legal requirement. Jihadis: ISIS has English language rules for all nurses. The NHS does not have the same level of checks . Although the law has changed, the Nursing and Midwifery Council must engage in a lengthy consultation process, draft new legislation and seek council approval before it can test the English language skills of nurses who trained within the EU. Students graduating from ISIS' nursing school will be required to spend a full two years working for institutions run by the terrorist organisation after graduating. However the announcement in Raqqa promised that graduate nurses who achieved top grades and showed the most promise at the school will be considered for places as ISIS' medical school, where they can train for better paid jobs such as doctors and surgeons. ISIS' English language rules have been put in place long before the NHS has been able to bring in similar checks. Militants: Students graduating from ISIS' nursing school will be required to spend a full two years working for institutions run by the terrorist organisation after graduating . ISIS has launched English-language radio news bulletins on its Iraqi broadcast service - complete with information on the latest suicide bombings and 'martyrdom operations'. The extremist group's first English bulletin aired on Tuesday on its al-Bayan radio network, which already boasts updates in both Arabic and Russian. The nine-and-a-half minute broadcast, which begins and ends with traditional sounding Arabic music, is hosted by a man with an American accent, who takes the listener through the main events of the day. It also boasts of ISIS fighters 'roasting the flesh' of their opponents, car bombs killing people and destroying an 'idol' and so-called 'martyrdom operations'. It ends thanking the listener for 'tuning in'. Last year the law was changed to make it legal for all foreign nurses, midwives and dentists from outside the European Union to be forced to take an IELTS language exam if it was felt their English made them unsafe in a medical environment. Since then 429 doctors from outside the EU have been refused a licence to practise medicine in the UK because their English language skills are not up to scratch. Similar rules were passed last month extending those rules to prospective medical who trained inside the EU, a rule quickly adopted by doctors and dentists. The rule is still not being by the Nursing and Midwifery Council, however, as the regulator requires a lengthy public consultation process before it can amend its rules. Even then the law will only apply to candidates who medical authorities judge could be a danger due to poor English language skills. In such an instance the nurse would first be required to prove sufficient English language experience - such as from a GCSE-style qualification - or they will be forced to take the British Council's IELTS qualification, to access whether they have reached a suitable level for their job.\n",

            "required :  Jack Nicklaus recorded his first ever hole-in-one at the Masters on Wednesday, as Camilo Villegas fired two in the space of five holes but still could not win the traditional par-three contest. Villegas holed out on the fourth and eighth as he finished alongside Kevin Streelman on five under par, only to find water on the eighth when he played it again as the third play-off hole. Kevin Streelman holds his trophy aloft after winning the Par-3 Contest on a play-off against Camilo Villegas . Streelman therefore became the latest player to be saddled with the 'curse' of the par-three champion, with no player ever becoming par-three and Masters champion in the same year. However, that was placed firmly into perspective thanks to his 11-year-old caddie Ethan Couch, who has a benign but inoperable brain tumour. Streelman found Couch via the Make-a-Wish Foundation and invited him to be his caddie in the light-hearted curtain-raiser. Augusta National's par-three course traditionally hosts the contest the day before start of the major . 'It was a really fun day, especially to have Ethan with me here,' Streelman said. 'This isn't about me today. It's about helping him out and showing him a great day.' Villegas said: 'I've made a few hole-in-ones, but it's pretty special to make them here. The second one, we were a little more emotional there. We just kind of jumped.' Nicklaus had earlier holed out with an eight iron from 123 yards on the fourth, his ball landing around 15 feet past the pin and spinning back into the hole. Woods played in the Masters par-three contest at Augusta National for the first time in 11 years . That took the 75-year-old six-time champion to three under par, but he would bogey the fifth and hit two balls into the water on the ninth to end his hopes of an unlikely triumph. Former US Open champion Curtis Strange reminded Nicklaus of the tradition that players who make a hole-in-one have to buy the drinks in the clubhouse when Nicklaus walked past the ESPN commentary position. 'Send me a bill,' Nicklaus replied. The Masters official Twitter account shared an image of Rory McIlroy and Tiger Woods with Niall Horan . The 18-time major winner added on ESPN: 'I never had a hole in one at Augusta, in the par three (contest) or on the golf course. Doing an interview this morning I said all I have to do is go out there, make a hole-in-one and win the par three. I had it three under and then choked.' Since the contest started in 1960, nobody has ever become par-three and Masters champion in the same week, a fact which sometimes sees players deliberately not shoot the best score possible. Most treat it as light relief and invite family or friends to act as their caddies, including Tiger Woods this year for the first time since 2004. Woods had his children Charlie and Sam on his bag and made sure he could not win the event by getting daughter Sam to tap in for par on the sixth. Jack Nicklaus (centre) with Ben Crenshaw (left) and Gary Player (right) during the Par-3 Contest . 'We had an absolutely great time. These were memories for a lifetime,' said Woods, who was also accompanied by girlfriend Lindsey Vonn. He later added on Twitter: 'I'll always have memories of my pop at Augusta and now Sam & Charlie. An amazing day.' Tournament favourite Rory McIlroy had One Direction singer Niall Horan acting as his caddie and Horan proved he should stick to singing after badly hooking a tee shot on the ninth into the water. 'I apologise to golf,' Horan joked. 'I do perform to a lot of people but we were performing to their parents today! There was a lot of pressure.' McIlroy, who is looking to become the sixth player to complete the career grand slam by winning a first Masters title on Sunday, added: 'I wanted to do this because it's a big week for me and just to go into the tournament in a relaxed mood. To spend a couple of hours like this was fun.'\n",

But that did not stop the Palestinian youngster, dressed in full combat gear, from attempting to pelt Israeli police with stones during violent clashes on the West Bank. The bemused officers, equipped with helmets and body armour, calmly watched as the child launched his own assault before racing away. The incident raised fears that Palestinian children are being encouraged to mimic and glorify violence. David and Goliath battle: A five-year-old Palestinian boy pelted the Israeli police with stones as violence erupted during a rally in the northern West Bank . The dark-haired child, dressed in combat gear, raced back to safety after launching a series of missiles at around six heavily armed officers . The boy's stone attack came as violence erupted  on the northern West Bank during annual demonstrations to mark Palestinian Prisoners Day. Soldiers used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse the crowd after more than 100 Palestinians rallied near Israel's separation barrier in the village of Bilin, with some throwing stones. At least one protester was believed to have been injured as violence flared on the streets. Prisoners Day is marked every year in solidarity with the more than 6,000 Palestinians in Israeli jails. 'We will not leave our prisoners in jail alone,' rally organiser Abdullah Abu Rahma said. 'We will defend their right to be released, because the majority of them have been arrested illegally by Israeli forces.' With Israel having arrested some 800,000 Palestinians in the occupied territories since 1967 - equivalent to 40 percent of the male population - almost every Palestinian family has been affected. During the last round of US-backed peace talks in 2013 and 2014, Israel freed dozens of long-term inmates. But after the negotiations broke down, and following the kidnap and murder of three Israeli teenagers in the West Bank, Israel arrested hundreds more. The current number of Palestinian prisoners is the highest for at least five years, according to figures from rights groups. More than 100 protesters used catapults to fire rocks at the Israeli forces after violence erupted during  a rally to mark Palestinian Prisoners Day . The Israeli forces used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse the crowd that had gathered near the West Bank city of Nablus .

            "required :  Gary Caldwell admitted his first taste of management was 'crazy' following Wigan's battling 2-2 draw against Fulham. The Latics may be heading for relegation but they proved they are ready to go down fighting after twice coming from behind to snatch a point at Craven Cottage. Caldwell, at 32 the youngest boss in the league, only replaced the axed Malky Mackay on Wednesday and must have feared the worst when his side conceded after just three minutes to Ross McCormack's strike. Gary Caldwell admitted his first taste of management was 'crazy' following Wigan's battling 2-2 draw . Wigan's Jason Pearce (right) is congratulated by Pennant (left) as he scores the second equaliser for his side . A stylish Jermaine Pennant free-kick hauled Wigan level, only for a stunning long-range effort from Matt Smith put Fulham back in front. But Jason Pearce's 69th-minute effort, when he tucked in a corner at the far post, earned the Latics a point. 'I have just said to the players that I feel very proud of them considering we only had two days to work,' said former Latics skipper Caldwell. 'It's crazy, absolutely crazy. An all-consuming job. But I loved every minute of it and can't wait for the next one. I've had a lot of managers texting me saying 'welcome to the madhouse' and I can see what they mean.' A point lifted Wigan above Millwall, who they face on Tuesday, on goal difference but both teams are seven points adrift of safety. Matt Smith scores Fulham's second goal to restore their lead against Wigan at Carven Cottage on Friday . Smith slides to his knees as he celebrates putting the home side back in front in the Championship match . Caldwell has not been put in charge to perform a miracle, but he still insists there is plenty to play for. 'We'll try to win every game,' he added. 'There's 12 points to play for and we'll try to win every one and see what happens. 'It's going to be a long process to get the club to where we want it to be. But tonight was the way we want to play, that's how this club got success.' Fulham should now be safe, having edged nine points clear of the drop zone, but they were booed off by sections of the home support. Boss Kit Symons' honeymoon period seems to be over, as his decision to take off goalscorer Smith after an hour was met with a chorus of 'you don't know what you're doing'. Fulham captain Scott Parker (right) is hassled for the ball by Wigan's Gaetan Bong (left) at Craven Cottage . The ever industrious Parker (left) dribbles away from the challenge of Wigan's Kim Bo-Kyung (right) 'Matt was shattered,' he explained. 'He's had a lot of football recently and we needed some fresh legs.' Symons has the air of a manager who cannot wait for the season to come to an end. 'It's glass half full, glass half empty,' he added. 'We're a point closer to safety and come the end of the season it might be the point that keeps us in the division. 'It's been a tough season, to put it mildly, and realistically it was probably always going to be like that. When we stay up I certainly won't be doing cartwheels, but I'll breathe a sigh of relief.'\n",

A Melbourne penthouse apartment in the Australia 108 complex that boasts 360 degree views of the city has been sold for $25 million to a Chinese businessman . The Melbourne apartment, which is spread across the entire 100th floor of skyscraper Australia 108, is the most expensive single apartment sold in the country . The new owner, whose identity was not disclosed, will have 360 degree views over Melbourne's CBD, their own private grand foyer and glass elevator.

Jet Set Candy, which offers a collection of destination-specific charms aimed at helping people to choose where they should head on their travels, enables you to take your pick of Britain’s Royals with the Marry British Royalty Spinner Charm, giving users eight possibilities for a 'future husband' - including 'King-to-be George'. 'Fancy your chances with Prince Harry? Got eyes for a Duke? Tie the knot with a British Royal and go from commoner to Queen. Your palace awaits!' reads the description of the fanciful charm, which comes in 14K gold vermeil or sterling silver for $198 and $148, respectively. Here's hoping: Jewelry brand Jet Set Candy's Marry British Royalty Spinner Charm comes in 14K gold vermeil (L) and sterling silver (R) and retails for $198 and $148, respectively . Eligible bachelor: Prince Harry is one of the eight 'future husbands' listed on the charm's playful spinner wheel . The charm has a double-sided Wheel of Fortune-style spinner, allowing wearers to predict their fate with one quick spin. While the front lists one-year-old Prince George and 30-year-old Prince Harry, as well as other more generic options such as ‘Duke’, ‘Marquess’, ‘Earl’, ‘Viscount’, ‘Baron’ and ‘Commoner’, as the options for your future husband, the flip side offers eight 'future homes', allocating you anything from a palace, castle or estate to an abbey, manor, house, cottage – or even foreclosure. Meanwhile, the charm silently acknowledges that 32-year-old Prince William, who is awaiting the birth of his second child with Kate, is already taken - by not mentioning him at all. The jewelry brand, which is perfect for anyone who has the travel bug, also sells similar spinner charms for other cities, as well as various destination pendants, luggage tag charms, link bracelets, engraved bangles and more. Jet Set Candy's founder and designer Nicole Parker King launched the collection in 2014 after traveling on six different continents and nearly 50 countries . Dream life: Prince George, pictured with his parents, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, is listed as one of the options for a future Royal husband . Same concept: The Caribbean Sailing Spinner (L) and the NYC Planner Spinner (R) are variations of the unique charm. Both pieces come in 14K gold vermeil and sterling silver . The sixth generation New Yorker recently moved back to Manhattan after living in New Delhi for nearly four years with her husband Chris, who was posted their as an Australian diplomat. But despite all of her travels, Nicole never came across her version of the perfect souvenir, so she took it upon herself to create it. Despite all of her travels, Nicole was never able to find the perfect souvenir to take home from her trips, so decided to make them on her own. And her dedication to reinventing travel keepsakes that are both cheeky and classic has paid off. Model-of-the-moment Kendall Jenner sported her brand's Amsterdam Windmill Ring in a spread featured in the February issue of Vogue.

Then came the admission that while Aidan, 31, very 'definitely' did not wear mascara to enhance his seductive stares, he was partial to a little eyeliner to define his smouldering eyes. Now, it seems eagle-eyed Poldark fans have a new question on their lips: just where has Aidan's chest hair gone? Scroll down for video . A good smattering! Has actor Aidan Turner, who has admitted to using baby oil to show off his physique to maximum effect, been 'manscaping' his once-hairy chest in favour of a less hirsute look? Definitely no 'scything' here...Aidan's chest hair looks distinctly more unkempt in this photo shoot for BBC comedy drama Being Human, which aired earlier this year . New images have emerged of the Irish star, whose brooding good looks have seen him capture a million hearts, looking a little more, shall we say, hirsute. In images shot to promote another BBC series Being Human, the actor, who is dating fellow rising Irish star Sarah Greene, appears to have a much thicker chest of hair, suggesting that he's done away with his natural rug in a bid to really show off the muscles underneath. Although it seems the BBC make-up department may have gone for a little gentle pruning rather than offering up the full, shaven reveal in a bid to stay true to the 18th century male grooming that Ross Poldark himself might have partaken in. It's unlikely that such a character would have reached for the razor, so a smattering of hair remains. Aidan's chest has been the subject of much viewer devotion throughout the series so far, thanks to the actor disrobing in plenty of scenes. Fans have taken to Twitter to comment on the latest Poldark male grooming debate. One viewer, @AidanTurner_Fan, remarked that she would rather see her favourite star with a full rug: 'Asked to shave his chest hair off?!! I'd rather he had it all!' Scythed but not clean shaven? The brooding star has stubble but not the bearded look the actor appears to favour in real life . Still brooding but a more natural image: A bearded Aidan pictured with his girlfriend Sarah Greene at the premiere for The Hobbit back in 2014 . While others have commented that even a smattering is too much. User Laura Kate said: 'I just can't forgive that chest hair. I just can't! But it's Aiden turner I could try. #Poldark'. And some got hot under the collar at the very thought of it. Tattooed_Mummy wrote on the social media site: 'I can't think of anything other than running my hands through Ross Poldark's chest hair.' The actor has confessed that he is 'inherently lazy' when it comes to perfecting his body beautiful and only really got in shape for Poldark as filming start dates approached. 'I worked hard for six weeks, killing myself in the gym, watching what I eat and staying away from bad food. But I would never, ever do all that if I wasn't prepping for a role.

            "required :  Ed Miliband has overtaken David Cameron as the most popular political leader for the first time. In a shock new poll that will send shockwaves through Downing Street, the Labour leader has jumped ahead of the Prime Minister in personal approval ratings. The Labour Party has also taken a commanding four point lead over the Tories with just 28 days until polling day, according to the pollsters Survation. Labour leader Ed Miliband has jumped ahead of the Prime Minister in personal approval ratings, a Survation poll has revealed . The revelation comes in the wake of a furious political row over the Labour leader’s personal character – after the Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said Mr Miliband could stab Britain in the back like he did to his brother. Mr Miliband responded by accusing the Tories of dragging the election campaign ‘into the gutter’. The Tories have pinned much of their election hopes on turning the campaign into a straight choice between Mr Cameron and the Labour leader. But the campaign could backfire if Mr Miliband overtakes the Prime Minister in the polls. According to tonight’s Survation poll for the Daily Mirror, with less than a month until the general election, Labour has opened up a four-point gap over the Tories. Labour is up 2 points on 35, the Conservatives down one to 31. Nigel Farage’s Ukip, meanwhile, are down three to 15 with the Lib Dems still struggling on just 9 per cent. The SNP and the Greens are on 4 per cent each. It is the biggest Labour lead in a Survation poll since February and was conducted after the party announced plans to scrap a ‘tax loophole’ used by wealthy ‘non doms’ to lower their tax bills. With less than a month until the general election, Labour has opened up a four-point gap over the Tories. The Tories have pinned much of their election hopes on turning the campaign into a straight choice between Mr Cameron and the Labour leader . According to tonight’s poll, nearly seven out of ten voters back Mr Miliband’s proposal to scrap the non dom tax status. Four out of 10 voters ‘strongly’ support the move – with just 14 per cent opposed. The poll surveyed 1,111 people on Wednesday and Thursday. Miliband announced on Wednesday that he wanted to scrap tax rules that allow wealthy individuals to legally reduce the amount of tax they pay on money earned overseas. The Survation poll found 59 percent of respondents supported the idea. A separate poll, by Yougov for The Sun newspaper on Wednesday, gave Labour a one percentage point lead over the Conservatives.\n",

            "required :  Mirko 'Cro Cop' Filipovic delivered on his promise to exact revenge as he stopped Gabriel Gonzaga in the third round of their long-awaited heavyweight rematch in Krakow.

Mirko 'Cro Cop' Filipovic made a slow start against Gabriel Gonzaga . After dropping his rival to the canvas, he finished the job with his elbows before the referee stepped in. Filipovic had not fought in the UFC since 2011 and made a slow start as Gonzaga stalked his opponent, trying to land with his hands. Brazilian Gonzaga attempts a leg lock submission against Filipovic . He took the fight to the floor, looking for the finish, but Filipovic defended well and pulled free, albeit conceding the round in the process. And Gonzaga continued to dominate in the second round, catching a kick and taking Filipovic to the ground and there they stayed for the remainder of a session that also went Gonzaga's way. But the fight was turned on its head in what proved to be the final round. After a clinch against the cage, Filipovic launched an assault on the break, dropping his opponent after repeated blows on the inside. Referee Leon Roberts stops the fight after Filipovic dropped his rival . Once down, Gonzaga was clearly in trouble and as the blows reined in, the referee stepped in to stop the punishment. In the co-main event, London's Jimi Manuwa made a successful return to the Octagon after a year on the sidelines by outpointing Jan Blachowicz.
